### Time Complexity

**How to analyze time complexity ?**

*Running time depends on*
1. Single vs multi processor
2. Read / write speed to memory
3. 32 bit vs 64 bit
4. Input

*Model machine*
- Single processor
- 32 bit
- sequential execution
- 1 unit time for arithmetical and logical operations
- 1 unit for assignment and return
